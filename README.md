## Background Story: The Need for Web Performance Analysis
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  <br>
In todayâ€™s digital world, websites are the backbone of businesses, organizations, and personal brands. Users expect fast, seamless experiences, and a slow or poorly optimized website can drive them away in seconds. Studies show that even a one-second delay in page load time can lead to a significant drop in user engagement, conversion rates, and search engine rankings. 
  
Imagine an e-commerce store experiencing slow load times during a flash sale. Customers become frustrated, abandon their carts, and the company loses revenue. Or consider a news website where articles take too long to load, readers may switch to a competitor with faster performance.

This is where Web Performance Analysis comes in. It involves measuring, diagnosing, and optimizing different aspects of a website to ensure speed, efficiency, and reliability. By analyzing key performance indicators, businesses can enhance user experience, boost SEO rankings, and improve overall website functionality.

This project leverages Python to analyze website performance metrics, providing data-driven insights that help optimize websites for speed and efficiency. Through automation and powerful libraries, we can pinpoint bottlenecks, suggest improvements, and even predict web traffic over 24 hours.

 <br>
The goal of this project is to analyze, diagnose, and optimize website performance using Python. By collecting and evaluating key performance metrics, the project aims to answer critical questions, including:

Where do visitors come from, and who are they? (Traffic Sources and Demographics)
How long do people stay on the site, and when is it busiest? (Session Analysis)
What do users do on the site, and do they find it engaging? (User Engagement and Behavior)
Which strategies are most effective in driving traffic to the site? (Channel Performance)
How many visitors can we expect in the next day? (Website Traffic Forecasting)

Using Python and data-driven techniques, this project will provide insights to optimize website speed, enhance user experience, and improve traffic acquisition strategies.

## Here are the Setup and Execution instructions:
### Prerequisites

Before you can run this code, you'll need to have the following installed:

* **Python:** You can download the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
* **Git (Optional but Recommended):** To clone the repository, download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  
* **Required Python Libraries:** Install Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, NumPy, statsmodels, and specifically, the plot_acf and plot_pacf functions from the statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots module, as well as the SARIMAX module:
    ### OR
  ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib plotly numpy statsmodels  # Use VS Code terminal or Google Colab
    ```
### Cloning the Repository (Use VS Code Terminal or Windows Command Prompt):

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/DataWithMowa/Website_Performance_Python_Analysis.git]
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd [https://github.com/DataWithMowa/Website_Performance_Python_Analysis.git]
    ```
### Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

1.  Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
2.  Activate the virtual environment:
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
### Installing Dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib plotly numpy statsmodels
    ```
### Running the Jupyter Notebook

1.  Start Jupyter Notebook from the project directory:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  Your web browser will open, displaying the Jupyter Notebook interface.
3.  Navigate to and open the `Web Performance Analysis.ipynb` file.
4.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially by clicking "Cell" > "Run All" or by pressing Shift + Enter in each cell.
