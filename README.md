## 📊 Data Overview:
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 <br>This dataset is a big collection of information about how people are using a website. It’s like a logbook that tracks who’s visiting, when, how they got there, and what they’re doing. It covers stuff like marketing channels, dates, user counts, session details, engagement stats, and info about the visitors themselves (like age, gender, location, and device). 
 
### What’s in the Dataset:
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 <br> 
Here’s a rundown of each column and what it tells us:

1. **Marketing Channels**  
   - This shows how people found the website. Examples are “Direct Website” (they typed the URL or used a bookmark), “From Social Media” (came from platforms like Twitter or Facebook), “Organic Search” (found it via Google), “Organic Video” (maybe from YouTube), and “Uncategorized” (not sure how they got there).

2. **Date + Hour (YYYY-MM-DD-HR)**  
   - The exact date and hour when the data was recorded, like “2024-04-16 23:00:00” (April 16, 2024, at 11 PM). It helps track when people visit.

3. **No. Of Users**  
   - How many unique people visited during that hour. Ranges from 0 to hundreds (e.g., 237 users at one point).

4. **No. Of Session of Users**  
   - Total visits (sessions) by those users in that hour. A user might visit more than once, so this can be higher than the number of users (e.g., 300 sessions for 237 users).

5. **Engaged Sessions**  
   - Sessions where people actually did something—like clicked around or stayed a while—instead of just bouncing off. For example, 144 engaged sessions out of 300 total sessions.

6. **Average Engagement Time Per Session in Seconds**  
   - How long people stuck around per session, in seconds. Varies a lot, from 0 (they left right away) to over 4,000 seconds (over an hour!).

7. **Engaged Sessions Per User**  
   - Average number of engaged sessions per person. If it’s 0.6, that means each user had 0.6 engaged sessions on average (some had none, some had more).

8. **Events Per Session**  
   - How many actions (like clicks or page views) happened per session. Higher numbers mean people were more active (e.g., 4.67 events per session).

9. **Engagement Rate**  
   - The percentage of sessions that were engaged (engaged sessions divided by total sessions). A rate of 0.48 means 48% of sessions had some activity.

10. **Event Count**  
    - Total number of actions across all sessions in that hour. For example, 1,402 events means lots of clicking or scrolling happened.

11. **Age**  
    - The average (or maybe typical) age of users in that hour, ranging from 18 to 60.

12. **Age Groups**  
    - Groups users into “Young Adults” (roughly 18-34), “Adults” (35-49), or “Old People” (50+). Matches the age column.

13. **Gender**  
    - Whether the users were mostly “Male” or “Female” during that hour.

14. **Location**  
    - Where users were from, like “UK,” “Nigeria,” “United States,” “Australia,” etc. Shows the website’s global reach.

15. **Device Type**  
    - What device they used: “Mobile,” “Tablet,” or “Desktop.” Tells you if it’s phone users, tablet fans, or computer folks.

</details>

## ⚠️ Limitations:
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 <br>

While this analysis gives useful insights into the 925 Fitness Company website's performance, it’s important to keep in mind some limitations that might affect the accuracy of the findings. These limitations include:

### 1. **Data Accuracy and Completeness**:
- The analysis relied on website traffic data, which might not show all user actions or fully reflect how users behave in the real world.
- Data collection methods, like tracking codes and analytics platforms, can have limitations that could cause mistakes or missing information.
- The "uncategorized" traffic source might have useful data that, if correctly identified, could change the analysis.
- **Implication**: The results should be taken with caution, as the data may not be complete or entirely accurate.

### 2. **SARIMA Model Forecasting Limitations**:
- The SARIMA model is good for forecasting based on past data, but it might not predict future traffic patterns accurately if something unexpected happens.
- Changes in user behavior, search engine updates, or new marketing campaigns could make the predictions inaccurate.
- **Implication**: The 24-hour traffic forecast should be seen as a guide, not a guarantee. It should be updated with new data for better accuracy.

### 3. **External Factors and Market Changes**:
- The analysis didn’t fully consider outside factors, like what competitors are doing, the economy, or seasonal trends, which could affect traffic and how users behave.
- Changes in the fitness industry or new technologies might also affect user interests and website performance.
- **Implication**: The recommendations should be flexible, considering that the market and outside factors can change.

### 4. **Single Platform Data**:
- The analysis only used website data. Other sources, like customer surveys, social media feedback, or sales data, could have provided a fuller picture of the company’s performance.
- Without these extra sources, the analysis is based only on the data we have.
- **Implication**: Future analyses should include more types of data to better understand user behavior and business results.

### 5. **Sudden Traffic Drop in April-May**:
- There was a sharp drop in website traffic from April to May, which is an unusual event that needs more investigation.
- The analysis couldn’t fully explain why this drop happened or how it might affect the business in the long run.
- **Implication**: The traffic trends should be looked at in light of this unusual drop, and further research is needed to figure out what caused it and what it means for the future.

### 6. **Correlation vs. Causation**:
- While the analysis showed some relationships between engagement metrics, it doesn’t prove that one thing causes another.
- For example, the strong link between "Engaged Sessions Per User" and "Engagement Rate" doesn’t mean that increasing one will automatically increase the other.
- **Implication**: Recommendations based on these relationships should be tried cautiously, and more testing is needed to confirm if one really causes the other.
  
These limitations should be considered when using the recommendations, as they are based on the available data and current situation.

## 🚀 Challenges and Lessons Learned:
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 <br>

Every project comes with its own set of hurdles, and this one was no different. Here are a couple of challenges I faced and the valuable lessons I learned along the way:

1. **Plotly Chart Rendering in Google Colab**  
   At first, I couldn’t get my Plotly charts to render in Google Colab, even though they worked fine in Jupyter Notebook. It was frustrating, and I spent over a week troubleshooting without much success. The lack of error messages made it tough to pinpoint the issue. Eventually, I learned that specifying the renderer (`fig.show(renderer="colab")`) helped solve the problem.

   **Lesson learned:** Platforms and tools have their quirks, and sometimes the solution is as simple as checking the documentation. Persistence and patience go a long way in problem-solving!

2. **GitHub Documentation and Time Management**  
   I didn’t expect the documentation process to take as long as it did! Structuring it, writing clear explanations, and staying consistent was more demanding than I thought. I realized how important it is to dedicate time for documentation from the start, as it plays a huge role in making a project understandable and reproducible.

   **Lesson learned:** Documentation isn’t just a side task, it’s a core part of any project. Organizing it well and paying attention to small details can really make a difference.

These experiences taught me the value of adaptability, persistence, and learning along the way. I’m looking forward to applying these lessons in future projects!
