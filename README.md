## Data Overview:
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 <br>This dataset is a big collection of information about how people are using a website. It’s like a logbook that tracks who’s visiting, when, how they got there, and what they’re doing. It covers stuff like marketing channels, dates, user counts, session details, engagement stats, and info about the visitors themselves (like age, gender, location, and device). 
 
### What’s in the Dataset:
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 <br> 
Here’s a rundown of each column and what it tells us:

1. **Marketing Channels**  
   - This shows how people found the website. Examples are “Direct Website” (they typed the URL or used a bookmark), “From Social Media” (came from platforms like Twitter or Facebook), “Organic Search” (found it via Google), “Organic Video” (maybe from YouTube), and “Uncategorized” (not sure how they got there).

2. **Date + Hour (YYYY-MM-DD-HR)**  
   - The exact date and hour when the data was recorded, like “2024-04-16 23:00:00” (April 16, 2024, at 11 PM). It helps track when people visit.

3. **No. Of Users**  
   - How many unique people visited during that hour. Ranges from 0 to hundreds (e.g., 237 users at one point).

4. **No. Of Session of Users**  
   - Total visits (sessions) by those users in that hour. A user might visit more than once, so this can be higher than the number of users (e.g., 300 sessions for 237 users).

5. **Engaged Sessions**  
   - Sessions where people actually did something—like clicked around or stayed a while—instead of just bouncing off. For example, 144 engaged sessions out of 300 total sessions.

6. **Average Engagement Time Per Session in Seconds**  
   - How long people stuck around per session, in seconds. Varies a lot, from 0 (they left right away) to over 4,000 seconds (over an hour!).

7. **Engaged Sessions Per User**  
   - Average number of engaged sessions per person. If it’s 0.6, that means each user had 0.6 engaged sessions on average (some had none, some had more).

8. **Events Per Session**  
   - How many actions (like clicks or page views) happened per session. Higher numbers mean people were more active (e.g., 4.67 events per session).

9. **Engagement Rate**  
   - The percentage of sessions that were engaged (engaged sessions divided by total sessions). A rate of 0.48 means 48% of sessions had some activity.

10. **Event Count**  
    - Total number of actions across all sessions in that hour. For example, 1,402 events means lots of clicking or scrolling happened.

11. **Age**  
    - The average (or maybe typical) age of users in that hour, ranging from 18 to 60.

12. **Age Groups**  
    - Groups users into “Young Adults” (roughly 18-34), “Adults” (35-49), or “Old People” (50+). Matches the age column.

13. **Gender**  
    - Whether the users were mostly “Male” or “Female” during that hour.

14. **Location**  
    - Where users were from, like “UK,” “Nigeria,” “United States,” “Australia,” etc. Shows the website’s global reach.

15. **Device Type**  
    - What device they used: “Mobile,” “Tablet,” or “Desktop.” Tells you if it’s phone users, tablet fans, or computer folks.

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 <br>

While this analysis provides valuable insights into the 925 Fitness Company website's performance, it's essential to acknowledge its limitations, which could impact the scope and accuracy of the findings. These limitations are as follows:

**1. Data Accuracy and Completeness:**

* The analysis relied on website traffic data, which may not capture all user interactions or accurately reflect real-world behavior.
* Data collection methods, such as tracking codes and analytics platforms, can have inherent limitations, leading to potential inaccuracies or missing data.
* The "uncategorized" traffic source, while noted, might contain significant information that, if properly categorized, could alter the analysis.
* **Implication:** The findings should be interpreted with caution, recognizing that they are based on available data, which may not be entirely comprehensive or error-free.

**2. SARIMA Model Forecasting Limitations:**

* The SARIMA model, while effective for time series forecasting, is based on historical data and may not accurately predict future traffic patterns in the face of unforeseen events or external factors.
* Sudden shifts in user behavior, changes in search engine algorithms, or unexpected marketing campaigns could render the forecasts inaccurate.
* **Implication:** The 24-hour traffic forecast should be viewed as a guide rather than a definitive prediction, and it should be regularly updated with new data.

**3. External Factors and Market Dynamics:**

* The analysis did not fully account for external factors, such as competitor activities, economic conditions, or seasonal trends, which could significantly impact website traffic and user behavior.
* Changes in the fitness industry landscape or emerging technologies could also influence user preferences and website performance.
* **Implication:** The recommendations should be implemented with flexibility, considering the dynamic nature of the market and the potential influence of external factors.

**4. Single Platform Data:**

* The analysis is based on website analytic data. Other sources of information, such as customer surveys, social media sentiment analysis outside of traffic numbers, or sales data, could have provided a more holistic view of the company's performance.
* Without those other sources of data, the analysis is limited to the data that was provided.
* **Implication:** Future analysis should incorporate a wider range of data sources to gain a more comprehensive understanding of user behavior and business performance.

**5. Sudden Traffic Drop Anomaly:**

* The abrupt and substantial decrease in website traffic from April to May presents a significant anomaly that requires further investigation.
* While recommendations were made to investigate this drop, the analysis itself could not fully explain its causes or predict its long-term impact.
* **Implication:** The findings related to overall traffic trends should be considered in light of this anomaly, and further research is needed to determine its underlying causes and potential consequences.

**6. Correlation vs. Causation:**

 * While correlation analysis revealed relationships between engagement metrics, it cannot establish causation.
 * For example, the strong correlation between "Engaged Sessions Per User" and "Engagement Rate" does not necessarily mean that increasing engaged sessions will directly cause an increase in engagement rate.
 * **Implication:** The recommendations based on correlation analysis should be implemented with caution, and further experimentation is needed to validate causal relationships.
